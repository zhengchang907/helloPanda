# What is Hello Panda project
Inspired by CryptoPunk project, we created 540 unique collectible pandas as first iteration with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain. This is an indivial project and my goal is to keep creating unique pandas with the unique people from all over the world.

I'm still working on an open standard that allow everyone contribute to this project by providing anything they like to the 24px*24px pandas.
